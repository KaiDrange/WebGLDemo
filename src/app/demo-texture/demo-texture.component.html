    <h3>Texure demo:</h3>
    <p>Here the fragment colours are sampled from a 4096x4096 image. Most of the relevant
    code is in initTexture().</p>

    <p>To map the image correctly, the model now has texture coordinates for each vertex. These have values
    from 0.0 - 1.0 regardless of image size.</p>
